Certainly! Below is an example of a `README.md` file for an automated network package capturer project.

# Automated Network Package Capturer

This project is designed to automate the process of capturing network packets in real-time and analyzing network traffic. It can be used for network diagnostics, monitoring, and security auditing. The system is flexible and can be configured to capture packets from specific interfaces, filter by protocols or IP addresses, and store the captured data in a structured format for further analysis.

## Features

- **Automatic Packet Capture**: Start and stop packet capture automatically based on defined conditions.
- **Network Interface Selection**: Select which network interface to capture traffic from (e.g., eth0, wlan0).
- **Protocol Filtering**: Capture specific protocols (e.g., HTTP, FTP, DNS).
- **Packet Analysis**: Ability to analyze packet data in real-time and save the results in pcap format for offline analysis.
- **Log Generation**: Automatic log generation of capture status and any errors during the process.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Compatible with Linux, macOS, and Windows (via WSL for Windows).
  
## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `scapy` (for packet capturing and analysis)
- `tshark` or `Wireshark` (optional for advanced features and more detailed analysis)
- Root/Administrator access for capturing on network interfaces
- `psutil` (for monitoring system performance and network stats)
  
## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Make sure Python 3.x is installed on your machine. If not, you can download it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/).
  
### Step 1: Clone the repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/automized-network-package-capturer.git
cd automized-network-package-capturer
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Install Wireshark (Optional)

To enable advanced features, install Wireshark or tshark. You can download them from the official site:

- [Wireshark Download](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html)

For Linux, install using the package manager:

```bash
sudo apt-get install wireshark
```

### Step 4: Set up Permissions (Linux/macOS)

On Linux and macOS, packet capturing requires root privileges. You can set the appropriate permissions by adding your user to the `wireshark` group:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG wireshark $USER
```

Log out and log back in to apply the changes.

## Usage

### Run the Capturer

To start the network packet capturer, run the following command:

```bash
python capture.py
```

By default, it will capture packets from all network interfaces. You can customize it using various command-line options.

### Available Command-Line Options

```bash
usage: capture.py [-h] [-i INTERFACE] [-p PROTOCOL] [-f FILTER] [-o OUTPUT]
  
optional arguments:
  -h, --help            Show this help message and exit
  -i INTERFACE, --interface INTERFACE
                        Specify the network interface (default: eth0)
  -p PROTOCOL, --protocol PROTOCOL
                        Specify the protocol to capture (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP)
  -f FILTER, --filter FILTER
                        Apply a display filter (e.g., ip.src == 192.168.1.1)
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        Output file to save the captured packets (default: capture.pcap)
```

### Example Command

To capture only HTTP traffic on interface `eth0` and save the output to `http_capture.pcap`, use:

```bash
python capture.py -i eth0 -p TCP -f "tcp.port == 80" -o http_capture.pcap
```

This command will:

- Capture TCP packets
- Filter traffic on port 80 (HTTP)
- Save the captured packets in a file named `http_capture.pcap`

## Log Files

Logs are saved in the `logs/` directory. You can find the following logs:

- **capture.log**: Logs of capture status and any errors.
- **system_stats.log**: Logs of system resource usage during the capture process.

## Configuration

You can configure the capturer's settings by editing the `config.json` file. This file allows you to set default capture interface, protocol, and filter settings.

### Example `config.json`:

```json
{
  "interface": "eth0",
  "protocol": "TCP",
  "filter": "ip.addr == 192.168.1.1",
  "output": "capture.pcap"
}
```
